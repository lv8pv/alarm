# alarm A simple Linux terminal alarm clock written in bash.

Every time I make my self a cup of Tea while sitting on the PC. I end up with a
full cup of Tea that is too strong and ice cold. More then once have I swore at
my **self** and *Slackware*, for not shipping with a neat little terminal alarm
clock I can start and remind me to take the **DAMN** Tea-bag out of the cup,
before it turns into grout and is too cold to drink.
